The author posits that critical re¯ection is the distinguishing attribute of\nre¯ective practitioners.

Essential practices for developing critical re¯ection are discussed.\nThis article de®nes processes fundamental to re¯ective practice. Teacher beliefs are self-gen-\nerating, and often unchallenged.

More students are coming to school\nneglected, abused, hungry, and ill-prepared to learn and work productively. To\ncombat increasing student alienation, and meet the scope and intensity of the\nacademic, social and emotional needs of today’s students, those entering the\nteaching profession will need to ®nd ways to create authentic learning communities\nby adjusting the power dynamics to turn power over into power with learners. These\nchanging demands call for teaching styles that better align with emerging metaphors\nof teacher as social mediator, learning facilitator, and re¯ective practitioner. Being\nable to function in these roles begins with teacher self-awareness, self-inquiry, and\nself-re¯ection, not with the students.\nBecoming an effective teacher involves considerably more than accumulating skills\nand strategies. Without tying teaching and management decisions to personal beliefs\nabout teaching, learning, and development, a teacher will have only the bricks. The\nreal `stuff’ of teaching is the mortarÐwhat holds the bricks in place and provides a\nfoundation. Being successful in today’s classroom environment goes beyond taking\non fragmented techniques for managing instruction, keeping students on-task, and\nhandling student behavior.

Larrivee\nin many directions, rather than stuck only being able to move in one direction as\nsituations occur. Effective teaching is much more than a compilation of skills and\nstrategies. It is a deliberate philosophical and ethical code of conduct.\nWhen teachers become re¯ective practitioners, they move beyond a knowledge\nbase of discrete skills to a stage where they integrate and modify skills to ®t speci®c\ncontexts, and eventually, to a point where the skills are internalized enabling them\nto invent new strategies. They develop the necessary sense of self-ef®cacy to create\npersonal solutions to problems.\nIf teachers latch onto techniques without examination of what kinds of teaching\npractices would be congruent with their beliefs, aligned with their designated\nteaching structures, and harmonious with their personal styles, they will have just a\nbag of tricks. Without tying teaching decisions to beliefs about the teaching/learning\nprocess and assumptions about, and expectations for students, teachers will have\nonly isolated techniques. Unless teachers engage in critical re¯ection and ongoing\ndiscovery they stay trapped in unexamined judgments, interpretations, assumptions,\nand expectations.\nOn Becoming the Critically Re¯ective Teacher\nDeveloping as a critically re¯ective teacher encompasses both the capacity for critical\ninquiry and self-re¯ection. Critical inquiry involves the conscious consideration of\nthe moral and ethical implications and consequences of classroom practices on\nstudents. Few teachers get through a day without facing ethical dilemmas. Even\nroutine evaluative judgments of students’ work is partly an ethical decision, in that\nlack of opportunity to learn as well as impact on self-concept are ever-present\nconsiderations. Self-re¯ection goes beyond critical inquiry by adding to conscious\nconsideration the dimension of deep examination of personal values and beliefs,\nembodied in the assumptions teachers make and the expectations they have for\nstudents. For discussion purposes, the term critical re¯ection will be used to merge\nthe two concepts of critical inquiry and self-re¯ection, and de®ne the distinguishing\nattribute of re¯ective practitioners. Critical re¯ection involves examination of per-\nsonal and professional belief systems, as well as the deliberate consideration of the\nethical implications and impact of practices.\nTypically, the terms re¯ective thinking, critical thinking, re¯ective judgment as\nwell as critical re¯ection have each been used to de®ne a way of thinking that accepts\nuncertainty and acknowledges dilemmas, while ascribing less signi®cance to the role\nof self in the re¯ective process (e.g., Dewey, 1933,1938; King & Kitchener, 1994;\nSparks-Langer & Colton, 1991; Zehm & Kottler, 1993). In Dewey’s (1933,1938)\nwritings, he asserted that the capacity to re¯ect is initiated only after recognition of\na problem or dilemma and the acceptance of uncertainty). The dissonance created\nin understanding that a problem exists engages the re¯ective thinker to become an\nactive inquirer, involved both in the critique of current conclusions and the gener-\nation of new hypotheses. According to Dewey, re¯ective thinking requires continual\nevaluation of beliefs, assumptions, and hypotheses against existing data, and against\nother plausible interpretations of the data. Resulting decisions remain open to\nTransforming Teaching Practice\n295\nfurther scrutiny and reformulation. Similarly, King & Kitchener (1994) posited that\none operating at the highest stage of re¯ective judgment knows that a solution is only\na hypothetical conjecture of what is, recognizing the temporary nature of any\nsolution. These de®nitions of critical or re¯ective thinking seem to suggest that it is\nprimarily cognitive problem solving.\nThe de®nition of critical re¯ection to be developed here attributes greater\nin¯uence to the role of self-re¯ection and critically challenging self-imposed limita-\ntions as well as idealizations. More aligned with this conceptualization, Brook®eld\n(1995) depicts critical re¯ection as a matter of `stance and dance’. The stance\ntoward teaching practice is one of inquiry, it being in constant formation and always\nopen to further investigation. The dance is one of experimentation and risk,\nmodifying practice while moving to ¯uctuating and sometimes contrary rhythms.\nOften a contradictory tempo is created through realization that students may\nexperience the educational processes a teacher initiates in unintended ways (i.e.\nself-re¯ection). Despite honorable intentions, the teacher may discover that students\nare humiliated or confused by actions intended to be supportive or clarifying.\nEngaging in critical re¯ection brings commonly-held beliefs into question. Beliefs\nare convictions we hold dearly, having con®dence in their truth, while acknowledg-\ning they are not susceptible to proof. Our beliefs shape our identity; hence shedding\na dearly-held belief shakes our very existence. If a teacher tries to shed the belief that\nthe teacher must be in control to be effective, it means revealing uncertainty and\nvulnerability.\nAs with all mental models, there is a clear distinction between what we profess to\nbelieve in and our values in action, those that actually guide our behavior (Senge et\nal., 1994). Our operating values steer how we behave on a daily basis to pursue\neducational goals and student outcomes. They also de®ne the lines we will and will\nnot cross. Values are our ideals; hence, they are subjective and arouse an emotional\nresponse. In teaching, often sets of values are in con¯ict, challenging the teacher to\nweigh competing values against one another and play them off against the facts\navailable. For example, a teacher may value being consistent while simultaneously\nvaluing treating students justly, and there are times when to be fair is to be\ninconsistent. To be critically re¯ective is to act with integrity, openness, and\ncommitment rather than compromise, defensiveness, or fear.\nArgyris (1990) pointed out how our beliefs are self-generating, and often untested,\nbased on conclusions inferred from our selected observations. In other words, from\nall the data available to us, we select data by literally choosing to see some things,\nand ignore others. He coined the term `re¯exive loop’ to describe the circular\nprocess by which we select data, add personal meaning, make assumptions based on\nour interpretations of the selected data, draw conclusions, adopt beliefs, and\nultimately take action. We stay in a re¯exive loop where our unexamined beliefs\naffect what data we select. Likewise, Senge (1990) referred to such deeply ingrained\nassumptions, generalizations, and images as `mental models’ that sway how we\nunderstand the world and consequently act. We frequently are not aware either of\nour mental models, or their effect on our actions. What we articulate is important,\nor `espouse’ is often out of line with our mental models, or core beliefs. However,\n296\nB. Larrivee\nwe do act in accordance with our mental models, often rendering our actions\nincongruent with what we espouse.\nWe develop mental habits, biases, and presuppositions that tend to close off new\nways of perceiving and interpreting our experiences. While advocates of re¯ective\npractice emphasize starting with one’s personal experiences, they also stress the\nimportance of critical analysis and reformulation of that experience (e.g. Argyris,\n1990; Brook®eld, 1995; Burbules, 1993; Kasl et al., 1993; Knowles, 1992; Mezirow,\n1991; Senge, 1990; Senge et al., 1994; Sokol & Cranton, 1998). While acknowledg-\ning the importance of experience, it is also important to recognize its potential for\ndistortion. Experience is culturally and personally `sculpted’. Experience is not\npureÐeverything is contextually bound. Personal experiences need the critical\nchecks provided by multiple lenses of students’ and colleagues’ perspectives.\nCritical re¯ection involves a deep exploration process that exposes unexamined\nbeliefs, assumptions, and expectations and makes visible our personal re¯exive\nloops. Becoming a re¯ective practitioner calls teachers to the task of facing deeply-\nrooted personal attitudes concerning human nature, human potential, and human\nlearning. Re¯ective practitioners challenge assumptions and question existing prac-\ntices, thereby continuously accessing new lens to view their practice and alter their\nperspectives.\nEssential Practices for Becoming a Re¯ective Practitioner\nThe process of becoming a re¯ective practitioner cannot be prescribed. It is a\npersonal awareness discovery process. While it is not possible to prescribe a linear\nprocess or de®ne a step-by-step procedure, there are actions and practices that are\nfundamental to developing as a re¯ective practitioner. The following three practices\nare essential: making time for solitary re¯ection, becoming a perpetual problem-\nsolver and questioning the status quo (Larrivee, 1999). The ®rst creates an opening\nfor the possibility of re¯ection while the others allow for a way of developing\nteaching practice that accepts uncertainty, recognizes contextual bounds and consid-\ners multiple plausible causal explanations for events and circumstances.\nMaking Time for Solitary Re¯ection.\nEngaging in systematic re¯ection means mak-\ning it an integral part of daily practice. Making time for thoughtful consideration of\ntheir actions and critical inquiry into the impact of their own behavior keeps teachers\nalert to the consequences of their actions on students. Teachers also need re¯ective\ntime to consider the inevitable uncertainties, dilemmas, and tradeoffs involved in\neveryday decisions that affect the lives of students. Any effort to become a critically\nre¯ective teacher involves negotiating feelings of frustration, insecurity, and rejec-\ntion. Taking solitary time helps teachers come to accept that such feelings are a\nnatural part of the change process.\nKeeping a re¯ective journal is one vehicle for ensuring time is set aside for daily\nre¯ection. Journal writing is a re¯ective process that allows teachers to chart their\ndevelopment and become more aware of their contribution to the experiences\nTransforming Teaching Practice\n297\nthey\nencounter.\nThis\nprocess\nof\nsystematic\nself-re¯ection\ncan\nprovide\nthe\nclari®cation necessary for teachers to gain, or regain, a sense of meaning and\npurpose in their teaching. Finding personal meaning is a key element in preventing\nteacher burnout. Journals can serve several important purposes for teachers. They\ncan provide a safe haven for dumping daily frustrations, working through internal\ncon¯icts, recording critical incidents, posing questions, naming issues, solving prob-\nlems, identifying relationships, seeing patterns over time, and tracing life patterns\nand themes.\nBeliefs about teaching and interacting with students are the result of attitudes and\nexperiences gained over time. By making journal entries, teachers can look more\nobjectively at their behaviors in the classroom. Journal writing is also a helpful tool\nfor examining personal biases and prejudices that may unwittingly play out in\ninteractions with students. Teachers are not always conscious of inappropriate\nresponses to students on the basis of culture, race, gender or social class. Making\njournal entries could allow teachers to look more objectively at their behavior toward\nstudents from diverse cultural and social settings.\nBecoming a Perpetual Problem-solver.\nA teacher’s modus operandus should be solving\nproblems not enforcing preset standards of operation. Problems surface as natural\nresistance to taking action toward a new possibility. The classroom should be a\nlaboratory for purposeful experimentation. A practice or procedure is never perma-\nnent. New insights, understandings, and perspectives bring previous decisions up for\nreevaluation and consideration.\nWhen all aspects of practice become the object of systematic inquiry, teachers\nmust confront issues of power and control in the classroom. As teachers think more\ndeliberately, articulating the rationale that underlies their teaching decisions, they\nbegin to name and confront the dilemmas and contradictions they face on a daily\nbasis. Becoming a perpetual problem-solver involves synthesizing experiences, inte-\ngrating information and feedback, uncovering underlying reasons, and discovering\nnew meaning.\nTeachers who engage in critical re¯ection infuse their practice with a sense of\nvision and purpose as they continually forge new ground. While they learn from the\npast, they thrive in the present. They know that much of what occurs cannot be\npredicted but they also know that they are not victims of fate. Not to be critically\nre¯ective puts teachers in danger of what Freire (1993) calls `magical conscious-\nness’, viewing life in the classroom as beyond their control subject to whimsical\nblessings and curses.\nQuestioning the Status Quo.\nWhen teachers make a practice of questioning the\nstatus quo and conventional wisdom, they seek their own truth and remain open to\nexamining the assumptions that underlie classroom practices. Because school poli-\ncies and teaching practices are both culturally and politically imbedded, changing\naspects of individual practice often requires a collective effort. Challenging cur-\nrently-held beliefs, assumptions, and expectations that translate into school policies\nand classroom procedures often brings a teacher into direct con¯ict with school\n298\nB. Larrivee\npriorities and hierarchies of power. By questioning institutionalized de®nitions of\nacceptable teacher and student roles, a teacher challenges familiar routines and a way\nof thinking that is comfortable for colleagues. Hence, those questioning the status quo\nwill need to learn ways of prompting colleagues to question their commonly-accepted\nassumptions and practices that are as non-threatening as possible so they don’t\nbecome the enemy, shaking up established practices. Although questioning the status\nquo is always risky business, the risk can be minimized if the re¯ective teacher can\nengage others in ways that are invitational rather than confrontational.\nCritically re¯ective teachers also need to develop measures of tactical astuteness\nthat will enable them to take a contrary stand and not have their voices dismissed.\nOne way to keep from committing cultural suicide is to build prior alliances both\nwithin and outside the institution by taking on tasks that demonstrate school loyalty\nand build a reputation of commitment. Against a history of organizational contribu-\ntions, a teacher is better positioned to challenge current practices and is less readily\ndiscounted. As Shor & Freire (1987) note, the most effective change agents are able\nto secure social and organizational changes while simultaneously doing personal\ndamage control.\nBy making time for solitary re¯ection, becoming a perpetual problem-solver, and\nquestioning the status quo, teachers come to recognize their repetitive cycles and\nre¯exive loops which limit their potential for tolerance and acceptanceÐthe vital\nelements for effectively managing classrooms composed of students from different\ncultural and social backgrounds with diverse beliefs and values. Re¯ective practi-\ntioners ®nd a means to catch themselves when they try to unjustly impose their values\nor dismiss students’ perspectives without due consideration.\nDeveloping the Practice of Self-re¯ection\nThe challenge of effectively managing today’s diverse classroom involves self-\nre¯ection as well as critical inquiry. By developing self-re¯ection, teachers become\nmore cognizant of the interdependence between teacher responses to students and\nstudent responses to teachers. Through self-re¯ection, teachers become increasingly\naware of how they are interactive participants in classroom encounters rather than\ninnocent bystanders, or victims.\nSelf-re¯ection involves developing the ability to look at what is happening,\nwithholding judgment, while simultaneously recognizing that the meaning we attri-\nbute to it is no more than our interpretation ®ltered through our cumulative\nexperience. When teachers develop the practice of self-re¯ection, they learn to: (1)\nslow down their thinking and reasoning process to become more aware of how they\nperceive and react to students, and (2) bring to the surface some of their unconscious\nways of responding to students.\nSelf-re¯ection encompasses re¯ection, deliberation, awareness, and insight turned\ninward so we continually discover new dimensions of ourselves. This complex process\nis not prescriptive in nature, rather it is a process that allows insights to surface which\nserve to challenge our familiar behavior patterns. It is more a way of knowing than\na knowing how.\nTransforming Teaching Practice\n299\nDeveloping the practice of self-re¯ection allows teachers to recognize that what\nthey see goes through a series of internal, interpretive ®lters re¯ecting personal belief\nsystems. Perception is subjectiveÐit is not pure, and it can be distorted. When a\nstudent acts out, one teacher sees a cry for help, another a personal attack. It is the\nteacher’s interpretation of the student’s behavior, or the meaning the teacher\nattaches to the behavior, that determines how the teacher will respond. Through\nself-re¯ection, teachers can learn to see beyond the ®lters of their past and the\nblinders of their expectations.\nTeachers can learn to reframe or `reposition’ classroom situations and school\ncircumstances. The term reposition connotes the notion of changing our perception\nby `moving out of’ our old position and creating a new position from which to view\na situation (Larrivee, 1996). It is our personal framing that shapes how we attribute\nmeaning to our experiences. Seeing new ways of interpreting a situation enables\nteachers to move beyond a limited perspective. By challenging themselves to create\na new vantage point, teachers can assign new meaning to the classroom situations\nthey confront.\nBy repositioning a seemingly negative event, the teacher seizes the opportunity to\ndiscover the positive potential in a situation. In repositioning, the teacher looks for\nopenings to extend and learn in any situation. Some productive ways of reposition-\ning for the classroom setting include: repositioning con¯ict as opportunity to be\nuncovered; repositioning confrontation as energy to be rechanneled; repositioning\naggression as a cry for help; repositioning de®ance as a request for communication;\nand repositioning attention-seeking as a plea for recognition.\nOur Screening Process: examining our personal ®ltering system\nThe meaning we attribute to our experiences is in¯uenced by various factors that\neffectively screen out some responses while letting others through. This screening\nprocess leads to differing perceptions of circumstances and events, resulting in\ndifferent interpretations, and subsequently in different responses. When we critically\nexamine our screens, we can become more aware of how our screens may be ®ltering\nout potentially more effective responses to classroom situations and students’\nchallenging behavior.\nActions are governed by multiple screens, which can be envisioned as a series of\ninterpretive ®lters (see Figure 1). Each level of screen serves to eliminate some\npotential responses while allowing others to ®lter through. Past experiences, beliefs,\nassumptions, and expectations, feelings and mood, and personal agendas and\naspirations can either serve to limit or expand the repertoire of responses available\nto a teacher in any situation (Larrivee, 1999). Beliefs about students’ capacity and\nwillingness to learn, assumptions about the behavior of students, especially those\nfrom different ethnic and social backgrounds, and expectations formulated on the\nbasis of our own value system can potentially be sources for responding inappropri-\nately to students.\nCertain responses can be eliminated by being screened through our past experi-\nences. For instance, the sight of a snake can conjure up a multitude of differing\nPersonal agendas and aspirations\nFeelings and mood\nAssumptions and expectations\nBeliefs\nPast experiences\nResponse\nSituation\n300\nB. Larrivee\nFIG. 1.\nreactions on a continuum from absolute terror to curiosity to pleasure, based on\nwhat our experiences have been. Additional potential responses are ruled out, or in,\non the basis of the beliefs we hold. Beliefs can be af®rming or defeating, expansive\nor limiting, rational or irrational. The assumptions that we make and the expecta-\ntions that we have can make more responses available, or unavailable. Feelings, both\nthose directly related to the immediate situation and those resulting from other\nexperiences, can either serve to screen out responses, or to avail us to additional\nresponses. Finally, the agenda we set for ourselves, and the aspirations we have, act\nas still another ®lter. We may become driven by our personal goals and lose sight of\nwhat we stand for. For example, a teacher might be so concerned about keeping her\njob that she goes against her own values to keep the classroom quiet because that is\nwhat the principal values.\nThe way we respond to circumstances and situations is determined by this\npersonal ®ltering system. This ®ltering system serves as a subjective mediating\nprocess. At the simplest level, there is an immediate re¯exive response with no\nthought process occurring. A re¯exive reaction, like removing your hand from a hot\nburner, is a reaction without conscious consideration of alternative responses. This\ntype of response is often referred to as a `knee-jerk’ response connoting that the\nTransforming Teaching Practice\n301\nresponse is automatic. Often teachers operate on `automatic pilot’, closed off from\nentertaining a continuum of responses. When they do this in the classroom setting,\nthey run the risk of responding to students in intolerant and disrespectful ways, and\ncan easily escalate, rather than de-escalate, student reactions.\nBringing personal screens into awareness, expands the intermediate thought\nprocess between a situation and a resulting reaction. By bringing a greater portion\nof the mediating process into awareness, teachers can increase their range of possible\nresponses to the often dif®cult classroom situations they face daily.\nAs an example, consider a teacher’s typical response to being criticized by a\nstudent. Suppose the re¯exive reaction is to automatically offer a defense to the\ncriticism, usually responding with a `but ¼’, rather than merely `taking in’ the\ncriticism, or exploring it further. Becoming aware of the teacher’s own resistance\nand asking oneself questions like `Why am I being defensive?’ or `What am I\ndefending?’ or `Why do I need to be right?’ or `Why do I need to have the last word?’\nwould represent challenging one’s screening process at the assumptions and expecta-\ntions layer. By challenging the usual way of reacting, the teacher allows a greater\nrange of responses to ®lter through the interpretive screen.\nOur cumulative layers of screens can lead to responding to situations in con-\nditioned and rigid ways. To have the greatest freedom of choice and the capacity to\nrespond uniquely to each classroom situation encountered calls for constantly\nexamining choices to see how personal screens are in¯uencing the ability to respond\nin unconditioned ways. As teachers challenge their screens and consider alternate\nresponses to reoccurring classroom situations, they become open to more possibili-\nties and no possible response is automatically ruled out or in.\nChallenging Beliefs and Limiting Assumptions and Expectations\nBecoming a re¯ective practitioner means perpetually growing and expanding, open-\ning up to a greater range of possible choices and responses to classroom situations\nand individual student behaviors. Teachers have to continually challenge the under-\nlying beliefs that drive their present behavior. However, the channel to changing\nbeliefs is not direct; it is through critically examining assumptions, interpretations,\nand expectations.\nSelf-created assumptions and limiting expectations can wreak havoc in the class-\nroom by creating a mental picture of how things ought to be. Assumptions such as\n`It’s impossible to teach this class the way they behave’ or `These kids just don’t\nwant to learn’ or `I should be able to control all the students in my class’ provide the\nbackdrop for the expectations teachers have for their classrooms. Such limiting\nexpectations can set teachers up for disillusionment and a loss of a sense of\nself-ef®cacy. Self-ef®cacy refers to the teacher’s perceived ability to be effective, ®nd\nreasonable solutions to problems and maintain a belief in one’s own capacity to\neffect positive change.\nWhat teachers think about themselves has much in¯uence on the choices they\nmake in the classroom. In addition to the anxiety created by the often-unreasonable\ndemands of today’s classroom, the teacher’s own dissatisfaction with self adds to the\nLevel 1\nPhilosophical\ncore beliefs\nValues, life meanings, ethics\nLevel 2\nFramework\nunderlying principles\nOrganizing framework for beliefs\nabout human development, human\nbehaviour and learning\nLevel 3\nInterpretive\ndaily practice\nPatterns of arranging life,\nroles, human interactions\nLevel 4\nDecision making\nstrategies/moves\nInterventions, specific behaviours\n302\nB. Larrivee\nFIG. 2.\nfeelings of helplessness. Often teachers fail to discriminate between the actual\ndemands of teaching and their own self-imposed demands. The pressure to conform\nto a picture of the perfect teacher lies at the root of much self-induced stress.\nIdealism, dedication, and commitment can result in unreasonable, and virtually\nunattainable, expectations. A teacher’s own limiting assumptions about a problem,\nor student perceived as a problem, can drive behavior in unproductive directions.\nBeliefs about the roles of the teacher and the learner, the nature and purposes of\nlearning, and the teaching and learning environment best suited to these purposes\nshape a teacher’s classroom decisions. These beliefs disclose a teacher’s operating\nprinciples related to how the teacher views student potential, motivation, develop-\nment, and growth.\nExamining Core Beliefs\nExamining our core beliefs is a critical aspect of self-re¯ection. A core belief is a\nfundamental belief about human nature, development or learning. Our beliefs are\nadopted based on conclusions inferred from our observations and interpretations,\nTransforming Teaching Practice\n303\nand they often remain largely untested. Developing the practice of self-re¯ection\ninvolves observing patterns of behavior and examining behavior in light of what we\ntruly believe. This process can be envisioned as ¯owing through several levels, from\nthe level of core beliefs to the level of speci®c actions. Similar to a model developed\nby Shapiro & Reiff (1993) to examine the congruence between core beliefs and job\nperformance, this multi-level process has four levels: philosophical, framework,\ninterpretive, and decision-making (see Figure 2).\nPhilosophy of life is the backdrop for all other levels and activities. The philosoph-\nical level embodies core beliefs and includes values, religious beliefs, ways of knowing,\nlife meanings, and ethics.\nLevel two represents our way of providing an organizational framework for these\nbasic beliefs and includes the theories we espouse, such as theories of human\ndevelopment and human behavior, theories of motivation and learning, theories of\norganizational development, and chaos theory. It is our framework for attaching\nmeaning to what is happening. These underlying principles serve as the basis for how\nwe organize what we have learned and experienced.\nThe next level is how we interpret these underlying principles into our general\napproach to daily practice. This is where we link our beliefs and theories into a way\nof behaving. Our daily practice is an overriding stance, a pervasive attitude for how\nwe approach life and the situations we encounter. It is a frame of mind.\nFrom our attitude about daily practice evolves our momentary actions. It is our way\nof making real our ideals and translating them into thoughts, behaviors, and actions.\nThis last level represents the translation into moment-by-moment decision-making.\nThe following example illustrates the four levels of the process for examining a core\nbelief.\nCore Belief\nA fundamental belief about human nature:\nEach student is doing the best that he or she can at any\ngiven moment.\nUnderlying Principle\nA principle that organizes experiences and beliefs; a\nframework for interpreting experiences:\nWe are all wounded by our unmet needs in childhood\nand our life experiences. Our wounds lead us to act in\nprotective, and sometimes hurtful, ways toward\nourselves and others.\nDaily Practice\nLinking of beliefs with a general plan of action:\nIf I hold this core belief and understand that behavior\nis often driven by unmet needs, I will act in a way that\nrefrains from judging the student and accepts the\nstudent’s limitations.\nStrategies, Moves\nLinking of beliefs with moment-to-moment decisions:\nIf I accept the student’s behavior without judgment,\nthen I will choose a behavior acknowledging that the\nstudent is not acting against me, rather to get unmet\nneeds met.\n304\nB. Larrivee\nOften re¯ection during, or simultaneously with, our actions is dif®cult because of\nthe multiple demands we have to juggle in the classroom. For instance, focusing our\nattention on completing a lesson may distract from paying attention to the way in\nwhich we interact with students. Hence, self-re¯ection often requires a perspective\nof a meta-position, a looking back after the action has taken place.\nThe self-re¯ective process raises our level of consciousness and this increased\nawareness provides an opportunity to spot incongruence or imbalance. Effective\nteaching necessitates continual examining and revisiting of our core beliefs, and\nassessing our actions against these beliefs. Developing the practice of self-re¯ection\nkeeps teachers coming back to their core beliefs and evaluating their choices in\naccordance with these beliefs.\nDeveloping the Practice of Critical Re¯ection\nThe route to becoming a re¯ective practitioner is plagued\nby incremental\n¯uctuations of irregular progress, often marked by two steps forward and one step\nbackward. There are necessary and predictable stages in the emotional and cognitive\nrhythm of becoming critically re¯ective (Berkey et al., 1990; Brook®eld, 1995; Kasl\net al., 1993; Keane, 1987; Larrivee, 1996; Usher & Bryant, 1989). The sense of\nliberation at discarding a dearly-held assumption is quickly followed by the fear of\nbeing in limbo. This state leads to a longing for the abandoned assumption and a\ndesire to revert to the familiar to keep the chaos at bay. Old ways of thinking no\nlonger make sense but new ones have not yet gelled to take their place, leaving one\ndangling in the throes of uncertainty. Yet, this uncertainty is the hallmark for\ntransformation and the emergence of new possibilities. This inner struggle is a\nnecessary and important stage in the re¯ective process. In order to break through\nfamiliar cycles, one has to allow oneself to feel confused and anxious, not perma-\nnently, but for a time. Fully experiencing this sense of uncertainty is what opens the\ndoor to a personal deeper understanding, leading to a shift in ways of thinking and\nperceiving.\nStages in the Critical Re¯ection Process\nAlthough in actual practice, the critical re¯ection process is more cyclical than\nlinear, more incremental than sequential, Figure 3 suggests a framework for concep-\ntualizing this process. The process of becoming a re¯ective practitioner weaves\nthrough a series of phases, the ®rst of which is the examination stage. At this stage\nwe start to question whether a particular action, reaction, or interaction is getting us\nwhat we want. It could be any behavior that we are bringing into question, such as\ngetting angry, engaging in power struggles, or withdrawing. In the next phase, we\nbegin to notice patterns in our ways of behaving and challenge the real cost attached\nto our current practice. When we move to the next phase, we have realized that our\nbehavior is sustaining a state we want to change, such as frustration, discomfort, or\nstress. This realization creates a surface desire for change.\nStage 2\nStruggle\nNew practice\nPersonal discovery\nReconciling\nChaos\nUncertainty\nSurrender\nInner conflict\nDesire for change\nChallenging\nQuestioning\nStage 1\nExamination\n32\nPerceptual shift\nFear\nCurrent practice\nTransformation\nTransforming Teaching Practice\n305\nFIG. 3.\nAttempting to let go of what is familiar leads to a struggle and we ®nd ourselves\nin con¯ict. This begins a critical stage in the re¯ective process. If this state of inner\nturmoil brings about too much fear and doubt, the choice may be to close down the\nprocess and either stay with the old practice or seek a quick ®x. We look for a\nready-made solution, a `prescription’ for change. However, when we do this, we\ncircumvent an essential stage in the critical re¯ection process.\nIf instead we are able to face the con¯ict, surrendering what is familiar, we allow\nourselves to experience the uncertainty. This not knowing throws us into chaos. At\nthis phase, if we `move into the eye of the storm’, we `weather’ the turmoil and a\ndeeper understanding emerges, moving us to the reconciling phase. In this ®nal\nstage, we have had a shift in our way of thinking and sensing. We have had a clearing\nand are seeing things in a new light. We engage in new patterns of thinking, and\naccess new tools and strategies to respond more appropriately to classroom situa-\ntions and circumstances.\n306\nB. Larrivee\nFacing the turmoil, the con¯ict, the uncertainty, and the chaos allows personal\ndiscovery to emerge. By completing the cycle and moving through the struggle stage,\nwe transcend a singular behavior change and undergo a transformation. When\nlearning surfaces from within, tapping our own resources, we experience an `ahah’\nand no longer need to take on other’s solutions. This shift restructures our way of\nthinking and changes our overall perspective. We are now capable of critically\nre¯ective practice.\nSummary\nThere are many pathways to becoming a re¯ective practitioner and each teacher\nmust ®nd his or her own path. Any path a teacher chooses must involve a willingness\nto be an active participant in a perpetual growth process requiring ongoing critical\nre¯ection on classroom practices. The journey involves infusing personal beliefs and\nvalues into a professional identity, resulting in developing a deliberate code of\nconduct. Critical re¯ection is not only a way of approaching teachingÐit is a way of\nlife. The more teachers explore, the more they discover. The more they question, the\nmore they access new realms of possibility.\nThe path to developing as a critically re¯ective teacher cannot be prescribed with\nan intervention formula. The route cannot be preplannedÐit must be lived. Teach-\ning in today’s classroom is a challenge of great magnitude. Meeting the challenge\ncalls for a teacher to resist establishing a classroom culture of control and become\na re¯ective practitioner, continuously engaging in critical re¯ection, consequently\nremaining ¯uid in the dynamic environment of the classroom.\nReferences\nARGYRIS, C.
