[Instructions]
You are asked to evaluate the quality of the AI assistant's answers to user questions as an impartial judge, and your evaluation should take into account factors including correctness (high priority), helpfulness, accuracy, and relevance. The scoring principles are as follows:
1. Read the AI assistant's answer and compare the assistant's answer with the reference answer.
2. Identify all errors in the AI Assistant's answers and consider how much they affect the answer to the question.
3. Evaluate how helpful the AI assistant's answers are in directly answering the user's questions and providing the information the user needs. 
4. Examine any additional information in the AI assistant's answer to ensure that it is correct and closely related to the question. If this information is incorrect or not relevant to the question, points should be deducted from the overall score.

Please give an overall integer rating from 1 to 10 based on the above principles, strictly in the following format:"[[rating]]", e.g. "[[5]]".
