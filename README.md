We open-source **LongReward** under `long_reward/auto_scorer.py`, a novel method that utilize an off-the-shelf LLM to automatically provide rewards for model responses in long-context scenarios, considering four human-valued dimensions: helpfulness, logicality, faithfulness, and completeness. Given a long-context-based model response, LongReward assigns a score ranging from 0 to 10 for each dimension, and takes their average as the final reward.

Please configure your API key in the `utils/llm_api.py` before run the code. You can also run the following scripts under `batch_inference/` for large-scale inference: `1_get_chunk_info.py`, `2_get_score.py`. `3_get_pairs.py`. The results will be stored in `./data`.

## ⚙️ Released Datasets & Models

### SFT Datasets & SFT Models
Our [SFT dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUDM/LongReward-10k) contains 10k long-context QA instances, whose context lengths ranges from 8k to 64k tokens. The QA pairs are generated by [GLM-4-0520](https://bigmodel.cn/dev/api/normal-model/glm-4), following the method of [LongAlign](https://github.com/THUDM/LongAlign). 
 Using this dataset, we supervised fine-tune two models: [LongReward-glm4-9b-SFT](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/LongReward-glm4-9b-SFT) and [LongReward-llama3.1-8b-SFT](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/LongReward-llama3.1-8b-SFT), which are based on [GLM-4-9B](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-4-9b) and [Meta-Llama-3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B), respectively, and support up to 64k context. 

### Preference Datasets & DPO Models
We utilize LongReward and prompts in our SFT dataset to construct the [preference datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUDM/LongReward-10k) for each SFT models, and open-source their DPO version: [LongReward-glm4-9b-DPO](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/LongReward-glm4-9b-DPO) and [LongReward-llama3.1-8b-DPO](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/LongReward-llama3.1-8b-DPO). More Details can be found in our paper.

## 📊 Evaluation

We provide our evaluation code for [LongBench](https://github.com/THUDM/LongBench) and [LongBench-Chat](https://github.com/THUDM/LongAlign) under `evaluation/`. Details can be found in `evaluation/README.md` and `evaluation/LongBench_Chat/README.md`. Remember to configure your OpenAI API key in `utils/llm_api.py` since we adopt GPT-4o as the judge.

To reproduce our results on other benchmarks, we refer to the code in [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) and [alpaca_eval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval) for evaluating on MT-Bench and AlpacaEval2.

Here are our evaluation results:
