甲骨文被发现后,对中国历史研究产生了哪些深远影响?请列举出至少3点。

[助手的答案开始]
根据文档，甲骨文被发现后,对中国历史研究产生了以下深远影响:

1. 证实并补充了《史记·殷本纪》关于商代历史的记载。通过甲骨文中对商代先王先公的记载,证实了《史记》作为历史典籍的可靠性。

2. 将中国有考据可信的历史提前了一千年。过去认为中国可信历史始于西周,甲骨文的发现证实了商朝这一存在了600多年的朝代。

3. 作为最早的文字记载,甲骨文内容丰富,记录了当时的政治、经济、文化、社会生活等,是研究中国早期历史的重要第一手资料。

4. 甲骨文的大量单字为研究中国文字起源和演变提供了珍贵资料,也启发并修正了后世的文字学著作如《说文解字》。

总的来说，甲骨文的发现对中国历史研究产生了多方面且非常深刻的影响。

How many members of the board of directors chose not to receive their cash retainer for 3 months in fiscal 2020, and what was the total foregone retainer amount in USD?

[助手的答案开始]
Based on the information in the doc, the following relevant details are noted:

- Members of the board of directors chose to not receive their cash retainer for 3 months in fiscal 2020. 

- The board of directors forwent 3 months of their cash retainer to help establish the We Stand Together Fund for employees facing COVID-19 related hardships.

- There are 11 members of the board of directors listed in the table under "Fiscal 2020 Director Compensation".

- The annual cash retainer for board members was $75,000.

Therefore, the number of members of the board of directors who chose not to receive their cash retainer for 3 months in fiscal 2020 is 11. 

With 11 directors foregoing their $75,000 annual retainer for 3 months, the total foregone retainer amount is:

- Annual retainer per director: $75,000
- Number of directors: 11
- Months of retainer foregone: 3 
- $75,000 * 11 directors * (3/12 months) = $206,250

So the total foregone retainer amount in USD is $206,250.
